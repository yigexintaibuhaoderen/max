## Downloading the source code
```bash
apt install git-lfs
git lfs clone git@github.com:thustorage/max.git
```

## Building Max (be root user)
1. Build the Linux kernel  
```bash
apt install -y flex bison make gcc libssl-dev bc libelf-dev
tar -xf linux-kernel.tar.gz  
cd linux-kernel
cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
make olddefconfig
make -j24 && make modules_install -j24 && make install
```
2. Update the grub configuration and reboot into the new kernel.
3. Build and install Max
 ```bash
cd Max
make -j24
insmod max.ko
```
4. Build the disk format tool
```bash
cd disk-tools
apt install pkg-config autoconf libtool libselinux1-dev
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j24
```

## Running Max
1. Format the drive
```bash
disk-tools/mkfs/mkfs.f2fs -N 8 /dev/nvme0n1
```
Note: the number 8 means the maximum number of mlogs. You can replace it with a proper number lower than 64.

2. Mount the drive
```bash
mount -t max -o imds=72,mlog=8 /dev/nvme0n1 /mnt/test
```
Note: the number of 72 means the number of file cell groups. the number of 8 means the number of mlogs.
    
Now, the Max file system is mounted at /mnt/test, storing its data on /dev/nvme0n1.

## Testing Max with FxMark
1. Build FxMark
```bash
cd fxmark
make -j24
```
2. Build Exim
```bash
cd vbench/exim
make -j24
```
3. Build RocksDB
```bash
cd vbench/rocksdb
make -j24
```
4. Setup the test. Open the file *bin/run-fxmark.py*.
-  Setup the tested devices in lines 30-33. An example:
 ```
HDDDEV = "/dev/sda1"
SSDDEV = "/dev/sdb1"
NVMEDEV = "/dev/nvme0n1"
LOOPDEV = "/dev/loop0"
```
- Setup the tested media and file systems in lines 61-75. An example:
```
self.MEDIA_TYPES = ["ssd","hdd","nvme",]
self.FS_TYPES = ["ext4","xfs","f2fs","max",]   
```
- Setup the workloads in lines 78-127. An example:
```
self.BENCH_TYPES = ["DWOL","DWAL","MWCL","MWUL","filebench_varmail","rocksdb_overwrite"]
```
- Setup the test in lines 632-635. An example:
```
run_config = [(Runner.CORE_FINE_GRAIN, PerfMon.LEVEL_LOW,("nvme","max","DWOL","72","bufferedio"), "", "")]
```
Note: the entry "nvme" specifies the medium. The entry "max" specifies the file system. The entry "DWOL" (data overwrite) specifies the workload. The entry "72" specifies the number of cores. You can set the entries to "*" to enable all media, file systems, workloads and numbers of cores.
5. Run the tests.
```bash
bin/run-fxmark.py
```
